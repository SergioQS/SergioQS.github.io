Explorations of the works of Henri Poincaré, Évariste Galois, Bernhard Riemann, Alexander Grothendieck, Michael Artin, David Hilbert, Leonhard Euler, and other prominent mathematicians.  
We aim to state and investigate some intriguing questions.

## Projects

### Poincaré and *Analysis Situs* 1  
In *Analysis Situs*, Poincaré addresses questions about space, connectivity, dimension, and emptiness. He introduces homology and the fundamental group using homotopy; this entry examines some sections of this paper.

### Euler’s Triangulations and Planar Graphs  
We study the Euler characteristic, the generalization of the formula relating faces, edges, and vertices of a solid to triangulations on surfaces, giving birth to topology. We will read the book *Euler’s Gem*.  

Coming soon…

### Lebesgue Outer Measure  
We define and construct the Lebesgue outer measure, examining its basic properties and its relationship with integration.  

Coming soon…

### Hilbert’s “On the Infinite”  
We summarize ideas and questions from David Hilbert’s article *Über das Unendliche* (1925).  

Coming soon…

### What’s the Deal with \(n\)-Dimensional Knots?  
In higher-dimensional knot theory, we present results from algebraic topology, including examples like Artin’s first 4-knots and the transition between classical knot theory and more abstract areas.  

Coming soon…
