We explore topics in **quantum computing**, **graph theory**, **information theory**, **computational complexity**, **machine learning**, and **neural networks**.

## Projects

### Quantum Circuit Hardware Efficient Ansatz  
We study two papers on phase estimation methods using density matrices on a real quantum computer and propose a new hardware-efficient Ansatz for quantum hardware.  

Coming soon…

### Quantum Convolutional Neural Network  
We analyze the papers “Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering Image Recognition with Quantum Circuits” and “Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks,” along with TensorFlow’s tutorial, and build a hybrid quantum convolutional neural network model.
